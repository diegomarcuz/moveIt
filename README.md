# moveIt

## Description 
Gamified Application which simulates the Pomodoro technique. Every time the countdown ends (it means you finished the 25 minutes of Pomodoro), a challenge will be shown on the right side of the screen. The purpose of these challenges is movement, makes you exercise yourself.

As right below it is demo, I set the countdown to 3 seconds, but the ideia is to set to 25 minutes.
